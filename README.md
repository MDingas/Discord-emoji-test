# What is this

Silly small project I made to play around with clipboard functionalities.

# What does it do

It transforms user input into discord emoji text

It tries to do the following(with some varying degree of success)

- Limit itself to Discord's character limit
- Avoid cutting up a word between lines
- Be neatly indented

Start by inputting

```sh
java Main
```

And promptly input away and the result will be in your clipboard
